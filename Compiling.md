# How to compile:

## Step 1: Download and configure QB64

1. [Download the latest QB64 version here](https://github.com/QB64Team/QB64/releases/latest)
2. [Configure and install it](https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64/blob/development/README.md)

## Step 2: Clone the repository

### Using a web browser
1. [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/all-other-usernames-were-taken/Asparagus/archive/unstable.zip)
2. Extract it into a new directory

### Using `git`
Run `git clone https://github.com/all-other-usernames-were-take/Asparagus.git`

## Step 3: Compile Asparagus
Open `asparagus.bas` with QB64 and press F11 to compile. It puts the (single) executable in the directory of the repository. Execute the executable ***via the command line***.

<!-- ***NOTICE***:
On Linux (I don't know for sure if this happens too on Mac) when you launch the interpreter from something other than the command line (including QB64), it launches but no window pops up, so you might have to force close it through System Monitor. Launch it from the command line instead. Windows does not have this problem.-->
